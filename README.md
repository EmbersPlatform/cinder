# Cinder

Nothing interesting yet, come back later

Note: this is currently heavily based on GitHub's Primer. Embers' unique styles
are yet to be incorporated.

You can build the project after installing dependencies with `npm install`.

# Building

Run `npm run build`.
You can find the compiled css in the `dist` folder and the documentation in the
`docs` folder.

# Development

Run `npm run dev`.
This will build the css and documentation, watch for changes and set up a dev
server at the `8080` port.
